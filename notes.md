Tested this latest commit on a non-programmer user.  

Non-developer user thought that:  
- the updater sends YOU an update about an item that needs to be sold (different meaning of word "update"; also, deduced presence of human actor outside the realm of abstract objects)
- adjust_quality(item, 1) means adjust quality of item TO one, not BY one.

My thoughts:
- programmers somtimes have mental models and trained habits that allow them to read code with fewer such mistakes
- for example they'll know that increase(something, -1) likely means DEcreasing something
- it's alright that the non-programmer wasn't able to guess correctly at the precise sense of the code - they are not the target audience, and their usefulness for code readability research is limited to learning about general human patterns that apply to code readability, not the specifics of code readability itself
